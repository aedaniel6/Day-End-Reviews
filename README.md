To do this one must decide on the behavior or habit the want to aquire, set a time to exercise said habit and pick a location to physically position yourself for success.
 
2. 5 basic things that one should have as a cybersecurity specialist and for the sake of personal cybersecurity in general:
      * Use a Password Manager-prevents you from having to memorize and create unique passwords  and email addresses for site. Passphrase/passwords longer than 13 characters are ideal. It is not tied to personal identity.
      * Have multifactor authentification- examples are fingerprint. Authenticator apps can be downloaded

4. The benefits of recognizing the need for mentorship and how it can be a mutually beneficial experience for both parties. Though it may not happen immediately or easily their are was to go about seeking a mentor such as attending business events associated with your industry, researching the individual on sites such as LinkedIn and attempt to "bump into" them or reach out via email for a 20 min one-on-one to see if they are a good fit for you.
