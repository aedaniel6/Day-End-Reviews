 **5 Things that Make a Good Collaborative Technical Team:**
 
 1. Python Programming:
    * A program is a set of instructions the computer follows to perorm a task commonly reffered to as software.
    * Machine LAnguage- binary 1's and 0's. Their are different languages and which one you use depends on use case. Python is a simple and popular language

2. Programming Languages:
   * C++, Java, C#, Objective- C, 
   * Assembly- (is a little better than machine code but still not readable to humans).
   * Machine Code
   * Commonalities: Intergers (whole #'s), Float (decimals), Characters (ASCII)
   * String- an array of characters. Ex ( Hello, World) is an example of an string
   * Boolean- True/False, Yes/No, 1 or 0
   * Conditions- If, Then
   * Functions- Takes in data and returns value. Mini programs within a program
   * Classes/Objects- Reusable building blocks of a program

3. Assembly:
   * Is above Machine Language. Processors have their own language.
   * Alpha numeric equivalent
   * Not really a language similar to machine code.
   * Tied to CPU processor
   * Not portable
   * More code
   * More control
   * Registers- working memory. Spot on a RAM chip
   * Stack- Last in, first out structure
   * Is an array
   * Random access
   * ELF- Executable Linking Format
   * Process- program core installed into RAM
   * Fetch
   * Decode
   * Execute

4. Higher Programming Language- Higher Level Language
   * To be user friendly (Ex. Cobalt)
   * The higher the language the language the less 1's and 0's. More human readable
   * Portable
   * Debugging is easier
   * Easier to understand
   * Machine Independent
   * Needs compiler or interpreter for translation

5. Assembly Code- is tied closely to machine code Has a 1:1 relationship with machine code
   * Compiled code- run through a compiler and turned into Machine code.
   * Can be compiled and turned into different machine code.Can be used on different processes and computer.

6. Program Development Life Cycle:
   * Define the program
   * Design the program
   * Write the code
   * Correct Syntax Errors
   * Test the Program
   * Correct Logic Errors

7. Pseudocode:
   * A sentence, assignment (one person to another)
   * Has no syntax rules and not meant to be compiled or executed
   * Plain text, human readable.

8. Syntax:
   * Clean syntax
   * Semicolon can't be used at the end of the line.
   * Name and name are not the same ( case sensitive)
   * Comments use a hashmark #

9. Indentation
   * Space at the beginning of a code line
