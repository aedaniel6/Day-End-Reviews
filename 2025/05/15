**5 takeaways from today**

1. Wireless Security- Open Systems- Authentication
   * Passphrase- or ask server for credentials ( aka Pre-shared key)
   * Enterprise (Kerebos, TACACS+, RADIUS) - You have to assign user (managed), MAC addresses can be used to authenticated device. Packet have to be
     encrypted. Methods are: WEP (deprecated), WPA, WPA2, WPA3.

2. Hash Algorithm
   * Integrity, nonrepudiation
   * Types: MD5 and SHA family
   * Symmetric Key( 1 key)- RC5, AES, DES, 3DES 
   * Asymmetric Key ( 2 keys)- DH Diffie Hellman, RSA, NSA, ECC family
   * Start with reciever, has to generate public, private key pair. Sends public key. DH loves key exchange using private key
   * Bulk encryption is single key. Everything else is assymmetric

3. WAN
   * WAN owned by Telco (AT&T, Xfinity etc)
   * WAN site- geo location or endpoint connected by WAN
   * WAN Link- connnection between on WAN site.
   * 2 Types: Point to Point or Multipoint (one site to two or more other sites)
   * Virtual Circuit- WAN connection logically appears to be dedicated
   * But, physically may have any configuration thru the Telco.
   * 2 Types: A. PVC- permenant virtual circuit. Established and maintain, PVC does not specify the exact role data takes.
              B. SVC- Switched Virtual Circuit VC established and terminated after use.
   * Dial-Up- Modem
   * MAC Address- Data Link tied to phone #

4. VPN- creates a tunnel and encryption.
   * Tunnel (Header, Encapsulated on network)
