 **5 Things that Make a Good Collaborative Technical Team:**
 
 1. Electromagnetic Spectrum
    * Invisible energy waves consisting of electric and magnetic field.
    * 8 waves (frequencies): Radio, Micro, Infrared, Visible, Ultraviolet, X-Ray and Gamma Ray
    * Radio and microwaves are primarily used for communication- 300Mhz-300Ghz
    * 1hertz = 1 cycle per second.
    * All radios are transcievers and all transcievers must be on the same clock.
    
 2. WLAN
    * 3 frequency bands: 2.4, 5, 6
    * Frequency bands can be divided into smaller Channels. You can tell the Network Antenna Card which channel to tune into. 
    * 2.4 lower frequency, longer distance (radio)
    * 5, 6 higher frequency, shorter distance
    * Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS)- hopping between channel while staying in the same frequency.
    * DSSS- popular moduation and transmission spectrum technology. Combine data signals withOFDM high bit data frequency
       A. Each bit is coded
       B. Signals distributed over wider area
       C. More bandwith
       D. Low power density/signals are harder to interfer.

    * 802.11 IEEE is wireless standard for military

  3. WiFi Specifications
     * OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex)- A whole bunch of channels at a higher spectrum
     * Combined signals on shared channel.
     * Signals are multiplexed in a way where the peak of 1 signal occurs at lowering of another. No interference, no overlap
     * A= 5Ghz/54 Mbps
       B= 2.4Ghz/ 11 Mbps
       G= 2.4 Ghz/ 54 Mbps
       N= 2.4Ghz/ 450 Mbps
       AC= 5 Ghz/ 1.3 Gbps (wave 1)/ 3.4 Gbps (wave 2)
       AX Dual band= 5Ghz, 6.6
       1q= vlan trunking
       1x= access control
    * Wifi does not like collision and will avoid at all cost
    * Ethernet standard 802.3 IEEE
    * 13 usable channels; channels 1, 6, 11  
    * RTS/CTS= access point rule

 4. MU-MIMO and SU-MIMO
    * Full Duplex
    * Multiple devices to communicate with router at the same time
    * Breaks up bandwith between multiple devices.
    * Router has to have MU-MIMO technology
    * Beamforming- signal is directed in multiple directs for specific (targeted) device.
    * New wifi 6 router can support 12 streams.
    * 802.11 ac wave 2 (wifi 5) has to be supported for MU-MIMO\
    * 5 Ghzs/ (wifi5) is the bandwith it works on
    * SU-MIMO- half duplex
    * Channel Bonding - combine 2 non overlapping 20 Mhz channels to create a single 40 Mhz (by adding an antenna)
    * l
