 Today I attended the BTS-Con Technology Showcase led by Ria Aiken with guest speaker Jean Harvey Johnson. The focus was AI and it's varied applications and benefits from a business as well as client perspective. 
 I also sat in on a presentation which exposed me to Microsoft Copilot 's capability to streamline projects and enhance decision-making.
 Also I had a chance to chat with Ian Perry-Okpara, VP of Information Security and Ms.Brenda Thompson in project management about skill transfer and what to focus on as a novice in cybersecurity.
