 ** Takeaways from today:**
 
 1. Analog and Digital 
    * Sampling- finding a sufficient number of examples to represent and reconstruct original signal ( Pulse Amplitude Modulation)
    * Sample Rate- per second
    * Quantizing- bit number in each sample. Matching bit level in binary value
    * Encoding

2. Cellular Network
   * Multiplexing- allows multiple devices to share a medium (wired and wireless)
   * TDM- divides time into slots so media can be assigned to slots equally. New method is Statistical Multiplexing determined by workload on the fly.
   * FDM- works for analog travels on non overlapping frequency channel.
   * Baseband- one signal at a time. Exclusive use of channel. Ethernet for example
   * STDM and TDM uses baseband.
   * Broadband- optical radio signal waves allows multiple transmission

3. Rules
   * Cellular use is multiplexing. Shared wireless media
   * CDMA- Code Division Multiple Access
   * 1G- analog, 2G Digital transmission, GPRS/Edge, 3G, 4G, 5G
   * Carriers have bought separate bands frequency. The carrier splits the band into different channels. The towers are assigned different channels within that band.

4. Modem                                                   COMPUTER

                                                          \
                                                          COMPUTER
  * Modems convert digital data to analog systems
  * Most places use digital and analog. So modems will be obsolete soon to straight, fiber and digital.
  * DSL use can use digital computer and analog phone at sometime

5. WiFi Router vs Access Point
   * Access Point acts like a repeater 
   * WiFi router layer 3
   * WiFi Access Point- Layer 2 wireless switch learns MAC addresses
   * WiFi- Extender- extend wifi range from router. Connects to wifi network then acts as access point. Wifi extender acts like a repeater

6. Wireless Encryption
   * BSSID- MAC address of wireless device. Single Access Point
   * BSS- Basic Service Set
   * SSID- is just the name
   * ESSID- used to identify Multiple Access Points

7. Range and Signal Strength
   * Interference and obstruction
   * Measured in decibels. The lower the number the better the hihger the number the worse

8. Wireless Adhoc
   * Adhoc has no access point
   * Infrastructure access point

9. RF Elements
   * Noise can be manmade or radio made
   * 2 types of attenae: directional and bonding
   * Wifi heatmap
   * Roaming- you have to dissociate from one access point to another access point. From one BSS to another BSS within the same ESSID.
   * Associated w/ access point- Active scanning and Passive scanning.
   * WDS- Wireless Distribution System
   * Hub and Spoke- centralized management and monitorig of AP's. Typically connects all AP's through wired link. Omni and Directional.
