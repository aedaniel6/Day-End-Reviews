 **Takeaways from today:**
 
 1. API
    * Application Program Interface- Takes request and tells system what you want it to do.
    * Interface is basically a waiter running back and forth between databases
    * Automation- is one task whereas Orchestration- is a series of tasks being "orchestrated together"
    * Virtualization- virtual not real. Creates virtual resources
      A. The real computer is called a host
      B  Hypervisor1 is bare metal
           APP       APP      APP
                HYPERVISOR
                HARDWARE

   * Hypervisor 2
           APP    APP     APP
                 HYPERVISOR
                 OPERATING SYSTEM
                 HARDWARE
  * Virtual Server- Multiple server OS runs on single host, DHCP, file web
  * Virtual Networks- allow virtual server/desktop to communication. Host OS allows the virtual network to communicate

2. Virtual Machine and Containers
   * VM Disadvantages- slow start-up and consumes alot of disk space, consumes alot of RAM and CPU Power.
   * Required license for each operating system. Each VM has entire O.S
   * Containers- Bundles everything needed for website w/o software or configuration. It has everything it needs.
   * Container engine unpacks files for kernel (core).
   * Container shares underlying O.S. Lightweight fast
   * If OS crashes containers crash. Good for micro services, dependencies can be easily distributed.
   * Docker- virtualizes O.S.
   * Container Spaces- restrict access spaces

3. Storage
   * DAS ( Direct Attached Storage) via SCSI or other connections. Thumb drive. Not designed for sharing data are growing business. Hardrive
   * NAS ( Network Access Storage)- Dedicated storage through network. One node on network. Available 24/7 with users over ethernet.
     Reliable, flexible and scalable, containers (to slide in hard drives)
   * SAN (Storage Access Network)- Storage resources. Dedicated high performance. Fiber. Can be accessed by TCP networks but not affected by TCP traffic.

4. Components- Host, Storage, SAN Fabric, SAN, Software
   * Fiber Channel- Initiator, Target-net port for storage device. SCSi, SATA, SAS.
   * FC Switch- for heavy transaction. Deterministic. Fault Tolerance and Load Balancing

5. RAID
   * Storage is important to fault tolerance.
   * Redundant Array of Indenpendent Disks.
   * Raid 0- is not fault tolerant and increases chance for data loss
   * Raid 1- fault tolerant. Data is copied on more than 1 disks
   * Raid 5- 3 or more disks "Stripping w/Parity"
   * Cloud- Scalability ability to handle increasing workloads by adding more resources (ex servers, RAM)
            Elasticity- the ability of a system to automatically adjust its resources to meet changing workloads in real-time.
