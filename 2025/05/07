**5 takeaways from today**

Today was professional development and Ron Confield came in and spoke with us about. He discussed several terms or characters in a story and the value of each role such
as: Hero, Guide, Level Up, credibility. The guide- the one who earns trusts and is important to have in your life. A few more things to take awaya from today is:
* Observe be quiet
* Pursue mastery of systems and processes not passions
* Don't be afraid to shadow
* Don't be the person that says idk and don't be the wheel spinner
* Think and act ahead or responsibility/role
* Reliability and Humility over pride and overconfidence

We also had the pleasure of Hadjii Hicks from Cox Enterprises come and speak with us regarding his beginnings and current journey. He shared with us his gains and losses
as well as some programs and projects that he himself has and still use.
