 **Professional Development:**
 
 Today we had Richard Cox of Delta Airlines come and speak to my and cohort 8. He walked us through his professional journey highlighting
 his childhood struggles with not being as naturally atheltic as his peers and learning to to outwork his peer to dealing with an ailing parent while still
 peforming as a leader. Their are few things he shared with us that he has learned along the way and some things he contiuously lives by. Here are a few 
 takeaways. 
 1. Rewards will come based on how much you do per se, but how available you make yourself to solve problems. Be able to solve problems. Be able to explain
    your process for solving problems and that will make you stand out.

 2. He also expressed to us how he was not good at speaking in front of people and how some individuals felt that he might not have been confident in him stepping into
    a new role. When in these circumstances when dealing with naysayers he said "let faith carry you" and your opposition will recognize you and even champion.

 3. Reccommendation based on experience vs decisions based on conviction. 
    Experience says lets find a solution that's tried and true and often times convenient. But conviction says stand firm, don't fold or default to easiest solution.
    Because the easiest solution may not be the best solution long-term.

  4. Build respect by doing the job you ask others to do. It does mean something to see the CEO lead a boardroom as well as a broom.

  5. People don't care about how much you know until they know how much you care. You can be the best cook in the world, what weight does it hold if you
     won't eat your own dish?

  6. Find ways to think bigger. " Golf club or a Golf Club

  7. Every month makes goals and create a set of habits over a long period of time. 

  8. Get comfortable with being uncomfortable.

  9. Grow where you're planted and be careful of the type of fertilizer you surround yourself with.

  10. Maximize your potential to maximize the potential of everybody.
