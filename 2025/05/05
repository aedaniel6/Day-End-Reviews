 **Takeaways from today:**
 
 1. Social Engineering
    * Brute Force Attacks- trial and error attemot to crack a password/ and credentials.
    * Rainbow Attack- precomputed table for cracking passwords.
    * Dictionary Attack- brute force attack with a predetermined list of dictionary terms

2. Nonrepudiation
   * You can prove that action occured. No denial.
   * Risk- likelihood or percentage of impact of threat that exploits threat and vulnerability
   * Vulnerability-  weakness
   * Threat- harmful event

3. Harmful Event- manmade and natural
   * Compliance vs Risks vs Technical Audits
   * GDPR- General Data Protection Regulation. EU Data Privacy Regulations
   * PCI DSS- Standards protecting cardholder

4. Risk 
   * Risk Management- identify, assess prioritize, vulnerability
   * Risk Assessment- security controls/ counter measures. BIA, BCP, DRP

5. Cryptographic- study of hididng info
   * Encoding data
   * Types: Hash, Encryption
   * Symmetric Key- one key, algorithm, 
   * Asymmetric Key- two keys

6. Hash
   * algorithm executes calculation on data (plain-text) to create fixed length.
   * Integrity and Confidentiality
   * One way street- secure password storage.
   * Encryption- converts human readable plaintext into a coded ciphertext

7. States of DAta
   * Data at Rest- hard drives
   * Data In Transit- TLS as it moves across the internet
   * Data In Use- TPM, HSM, (ex RAM)

8. Vulnerabilities
   * Software flaws, misconfigurations, poo practices, allows malware install etc..
   * Zero-Day Vulnerability- security weakness, flaw in software, hardware, firmware unknown to vendor and development
   * Zero Day Exploit- malicious code/technique specifically designed to take advantage of zero-day vulnerability attack
     leverages exploit to; A. gain unauthorized access, B. steal data C. public key encryption

9. HoneyPots vs HoneyNet
   * Threat Types:
     Nation State
     Organized Crime
     Internal Threat Actor
     Hactivist
     External Threat Actor

10. Enumeration
    * to gather information about vulnerabiliies and target
    * footprints- non intrusive (non specific)
    * fingerprints- intrusive and intentional
    * fileless malware- located in RAM. when computer cuts off malware dies
