**5 Takeaways from Professional Developement**

Today in professional developement, we had CISO Edwin Katabaro come and provide cohort 8 with a presentation regarding his journey and decisions made personally as well as professionally. 
Here are a few insights he imparted with us: 

1. Figure out what you enjoy in your field and build skills around that.

2. Network.

3. Be willing to take one step back to move four steps forward. 

4. Give back.

5. Get the experience that matches your desired role. This includes research, staying up to date and even interviewing for positions similar to your desired role to stay "fresh" and cognizant of what the industry is looking for.
