 **Takeaways from Today:**
 
 1. Authorization and Access Control
   * Discretionary Access Control (DAC) -owner or resources determining how it is shared. Whoever creates resource is owner. Distributed not centralized.  
   * API (Application Programming Interface) -brings authorization protocol and policies
   * Possible data leaks
   * Based off trust
   * Permission management is individual
   
2. Role Based Access Control (RBAC)- 
   * Allows safe space for constructive feedback and collaboration without fear or judgement
   * Rights/Access is associated with role
   * Not direct access, based on what roles haves access to is based on rights
   * Policy defines roles and access does not change when you leave the organization.
   * New employee should be able to activate the desired role
   * Revisiting Least Privilege. You can't negatively affect resources you don't have access to.
   * User in 1 role has access to a subset of the files.
   * Switch roles to gain access to other resources

3. 802.1x NAC
   * Network Access Control
   * Port based
   * Authenticates switch-level
   * Access Point
   * Relies CAS Central Authetication Server
    
4. Principle of Least
   * User, programs, process has minimum rights and permissions.
   * PAM= Privilege Access Management 
   * System Admin (root)- control elevated access
   * All activities are logged

5. Privilege Escalation
   * Increase in privileges
   * Up

6. Separation of Duties
   * Checks and balances against possibility that critical sytstems or procedures.
   * Divide tasks prevents ethical conflicts of abuse of power.

7. Zero Trust
   * Perimeter Focus- (Digital)Firewall, proxy servers. (Physical) locks and gates
   * DOD Defense in Depth- Multilayer security controls and countermeasures
   * Comprehensive approach to protocol and organizes assets.

8. Access Control List
   * Filters, port, IP Address
   * Implicit deny's packets not matching rules are automatically dropped

9. Firewall Types
   * Stateless- data flow
   * Stateful- conversation not 1 at a time
   * Circuit Level- session layer ( start, maintain , stop)
   * Application Layer- proxy firewall ex proxy server and typically web based
   * UTM Unified Threat Management all in one, firewall, switch, router, load balancer
