 ** Takeaways from today:**
 
 1. Ethernet Introduction and Recap
    * Ethernet- Chaos, fast. Use a switch to split extra devices on ethernet.
    * MAC Address- to communicate. Use a MAC Table or CAM so switch can learn where MAC addresses are located
    * Lattice Network is built into switches (MESH topology)
    * Protocol- CSMA/CD ( Carrier Sense Multiple Access Collision Detection
  
 2. Ethernet operates on physical and data link layer
    * Ethernet on physical layer is wiring and cabling
    * Ethernet on data link layer is MAC address and CSMA/CD
    * Baseband is a single signal (twisted-pair)
    * Broadband is multiple signal (fiber-optic)

 3. Full Duplex, Half Duplex, Simplex
    * Full Duplex- switch
    * Half Duplex- Hub, bus

 4. Fiber- Long Range, Short Range < FX, LR, SR
    Twisted Pair TP- Cat 3, 5e, 6a, 7a, 8a
    Broadband- 100 Base, 20G, 10G, 40G
    F Tyoe- connector for coax
    Baseband- Digital signal 
    Broadband- frequency 
  
 4. Bridge- connects 2 or more networks, segments on Data link layer deals with MAC address control data flow
    Switches are preferred over bridge

 5. Ethernet Frame
    * Frame Payload 1500-1515
    * Network Card - Transmit and Recieve " Transceiver"
    * Transmission unit
      Destination MAC
      Source MAC
      Data Payload (1500 bytes per frame)
      FCS

6. Autonegotiation Protocol
   * Full Duplex communicaton
   * Host device chooses highest speed/duplex
   * fast link pulse
   * TP cable ( RJ45)
   * No collision
   * More switches for more conections
   * NO Hub prevents collision
