 **Network Topology and Troubleshooting:**
 
 1. Peer to Peer and Client Network:
    * Peer to peer- decentralized
    * Client Net-  every device acts as a client server
    
 2. Topologies
    * Physical- follow the cable
    * Logical- 1's and 0's
    * Point to point- one device connects to another. Foundations to all other topologies
    * Bus- troubleshooting id hard and so is maintenance
    * Star-Ring- Physical star and logical ring. Data flows in central device.
    * Mesh Topology- 2 types Partially meshed (physical connection) Fully Meshed (wireless connection)
       
 **Model Concepts**
 1. Physical Layer 
   * Wired ( twisted, coax, fiber optic, media converter)
   * Repeater- amplify signals (digital-steps)
   * Amplifier- amplify signals (analog-wireless)
 
 2. Data Encapsulation
    * Sender- Transport layer- each block ahs a header
    * Network Layer- add IP header
    * Physical- Electric, radio, light signal.

  3. De- Encapsulation
     * Reciever- Datalink-frame discarded if match
     * Network- Ip packet discarded if match
     * Transport- part # specifies operation encryption removed, data regular format.

  4. SOHO ( Small Office Home Office)
     * All in one devicee
     * DSL/CAble
     * Minimal Config
     * Enable/Disable frequency
     * Pick SSID security
     * DNS Server
     * LAN
