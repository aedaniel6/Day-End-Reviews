 **Takeaways from today:**
 
 1. Network- Route Packets
   * Data Link- MAC Ethernet
   * How do routers communicate with each other? What are the rules and protocols? In band network?
  
 2. Routing Rules/Protocols
    * Static- physically go to location to configure. Simplicity, seure and predictable.
    * Dynamic- automatically learns routes. Point is to find "best route" vs "best path". Algorithm based.
    * Best route acan be speed vs distance "hops"
    
3. Why do we need both IP and MAC address?
   * MAC is useful for local communication
   * Broadcast domain internet no possible 
   * Loss of hardware = loss of all exiting connect.
   * IP can change. Can group and organize different networks.

4. Routing Technologies
   * Jacks =Interface physically it's one jack we figuratively have 3 Jacks b/c we configured it. These figurative (imaginary) interfaces are called sub interfaces.

5. Distance Vector vs Link State vs Hybrid vs Exterior
    * Distance Vector- Neighbor, Rumor, Hop, RIP, IGRP, Old School
    * Link State- Delay, Hops, bandwith, OSPF -IS-IS, CPU/RAM, reliability
    * Hybrid- EIGRP
    * Exterior- BGP/ Internet
