 **Cable, Wires,Connector, and Troubleshooting:**
 
 1. Shielded twisted pair 
    * Stranded which is made up of a bundle of strands.  
    * Solid is a single copper cable that's better for conduction. Maximum length a hundred meters from wall to computer. All devices are nodes

 2. EIA and TIA
    * Twisted pair copper based.
    * Two types: 8 wire is RJ45 and 4 wire is RJ11. 
    * RJ45 made for computer data and RJ11 is more suited for telephone. 4 wire won't  typically won't have shielded twisted pair. Coax cable connector has p v c or fire resistant cover. PVC m/teflon insulator.

3. Industry standard is 50 to 75 ohms.
   * Twisted pair has higher transmission rates
   * Flexible is better for ethernet and telephone systems. 
   * Better crosstalk reduction

3. Fiber optic 
   * Can be single mode or multi mode.
   * More expensive connector better quality. Rx= reciever Tx=Transmission. 
   * The must criss cross. 
   * Types of fiber optic cables 
   * ST which is twisted straight tip cable.
   * SC which is clamp/click cable 
   * LC double cable.

4. TIA/EIA Are the standards for how to install connector to cable. 
   * If it's labeled A Is for government and B is for business.
   * Structured cabling 
   * Includes entrance demark m d f and I d f.
   * Patch panel is from wall to computer. Workarea to Idf.
   * Half duplex is like a walkie-talkie.Talk stop talk stop
   * Full duplex is different frequencies talk listen telephone. 

5. Attenuation is signal loss.
   * Data turns into a digital signal via encoding and decoding.
   * Analog data is modulated and demodulate it .
   * The NIC card transmits and receives digital signal.
   * latency is delayed during signal.

6. Things that cause EMI are generators and phones. 
   * Cross talk is bleeding over into another signal
   * Short circuit is when 2 wires touch or something like a nail touches it. 
   * Open circuit is cut or open.
   * Tone generator finds which cable is active when it is not labeled
