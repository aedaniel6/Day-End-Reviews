 **Takeaways from today:**
 
 1.Network Ports:
   * HTTP/S=80/443         * DHCP=67/68       * VOIP(SIP)=5061
   * FTP=21                * DNS=53           * LDAP=389
   * SMTP=25               * SSH=22           * SMB=445
   * POP=110               * TELNET=23        * RDP=3389
   * IMAP=143              * TFTP=69          * MYSQL

      APPLICATION ====PAYLOAD
      TRANSPORT TCP- SEGMENTS, CONNECTIONS, HANSHKES, FLOW CONTROL, SEQUENCNG
      TRANSPORT UDP- FAST, CONNECTIONLESS
   * "3 Way Handshake" 1. SYN/ 2. SYN ACK/ 3. ACK RECEIVED 

 2. Port Ranges:
    * 0-65535 is full range for port numbering
    * 0-1023 System otherwise known as "well known ports"
    * 1024- 49151 User "registered ports"
    * 49152-65535 Dynamic/private ports. Ephemeral

3. Netstat:
   * that displays open network sockets, routing tables, and a number of network interface
   *  Command  list of all active TCP connections on the computer
   * -n command displays active TCP connections, however, addresses and port numbers are expressed numerically 
   * -a command displays all active connections and the TCP and UDP ports on which the computer is listening.
   * -b command displays the binary (executable) program's name involved in creating each connection or listening port.
   * -f command displays fully qualified domain names 
   * -an command displays al active network addresses and port numbers by name
   * -t command displays fully qualified domain names 
   * -p command show which processes are using which sockets (similar to -b under Windows) (you must be root to do this)

4. DHCP Server
  * A router has 3 devices on its network with different subnets, How does the DHCP server communicate past router?
    it uses a DHCP Relay Agent and acgs as a proxy. It is an enable service.

                          DHCPSERVER ( Scope, Range-Release, Lease-time, Collision)
            SUITE
COMPUTER
(Relay Agent)

* A layer 3 switch can also relay/release.
* 1 router to multiple switches
* IPv6 MAC addresses use APIPA to assign addresses.
