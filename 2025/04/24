 **Firewall:**
 
 1. Firewall
    * Filters and allows/denies traffic based off a set of rules and protocols.
    * Routers strips MAC and looks at source. Destination for packet.
    * Added service Access Control List turns router into firewall.

2. 2 Types of Firewall:
    * Stateful- "Data Flow", Detect, Prevents certain types of attacks, "conversation", Resource intensive.
      safer. Operates on OSI layers 4 and 5. Circuit level gateway (session layer)
    * Stateless- Just packet, packet filtering, no history, fast, 1 at a time.
    * UTM- Unified Threat Management Firewall intrusion prevention, all in one, switch, router, load balancer, etc

3. What do these firewalls look like:
   * Hardware based- Network, physical, (ex. SOHO)
   * Software based- Malware, bytes, (ex Microsoft Defender)
   * Appliance- UTM standalone only performs firewall function. Small office w/o physical components. Remote w/o technician
     to manage security components
     
 4. Proxy Servers:
    * Forwards requests and response on behalf of client, uses app filtering, located at the perimeter network.
    * Mediator "middle man", "Agent-client", can bypass firewall, application layer, firewall (WAF0, cache, forward proxy vs reverse proxy,
      Forward client -----> Internet-----> Server 
      Server <-----Internet<----- Reverse client
    * NAT- "port forwarding ", "malicious traffic content", load balancing

  5. VLANS:
     * PAN- Personal Area Network- Wireless /USB technology. Laptops, cell phones, transfer small files
     * LAN- Local Area Networks- Close proximity, Ethernet LAN connects w/ Ethernet switch. Wireless LAN at least 2 devices to connect to LAN. 
       Has wireless access point.
     * CAN- Campus Area Network- Networking components owned by a campus tenant. Limited to geographic region.
     * MAN- Metropolitan Area Network- Metro area, bigger than CAN. Uses fiber optic cable to share resources
     * SAN- Storage Area Network- Webserver, database, email. Connects multiple servers w/switch. Partitioned off, a network all its own.
     * WAN- Wide Area Network- The Internet.

  6. Topologies:
    * Physical
    * Logical
    * Point to point
    * Bus
    * Mesh - partially and fully
    * Ring
    * Star/ Star-ring

  7. Three-tiered Network Hierarchy- Cisco design for Campus Network
    * Three Layers- Access, Distribution, Core
    * Prevents scalability, resilience, manageability.
