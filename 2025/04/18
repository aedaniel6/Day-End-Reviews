_2025-04-18_

**5 takeaways from today**

1. Terms learned today:
   * Classful/Classless
   * CIDR 9 Classless Inter-Domain Routing
   * Static IP Addressing
   * APIPA Automatic Private IP Address
   * ARP Address Resolution Protocol
   * Unicast, Multicast, Broadcast
   
2. Variable Length Subnet Mask
   * Vary or moves things around
   * CIDR- part of an octet to be used for the Network address "partial subnetting"
   
3. IP Addressing nad Forwarding
   * Networking
     Data- Forward frames
     Physical- Route Packets
  PACKET----->ROUTER----->PACKETS
   *Terms:
   * ARP- maps MAC address---->IP address
   * DNS- maps IP address----->Domain Name
   * Default Gateway-helps ypu get to Internet via Router and Firewall
   * SOHO- Router firewall, DHCP and NAT included. All in One.
   * DHCP gives out all address (DNS, Gateway etc) via ipconfig /all command.
   * But Gateway has ip address but how does it find MAC address? BROADCAST
   * Send unicast to one person

4. Broadcat, Unicast, Multicast
   * Broadcast- 1 to all
   * Unicast- 1 to 1
   * Multicast- 1 to group
   * Ipv4 doe NOT use broadcast domain
   * IPv6 uses unicast, multicast and anycast
5. Find solutions to known problems. Look around and figure out how can this be made better or more sensible. For example, rolling suitcases or shirts with no tag etc
