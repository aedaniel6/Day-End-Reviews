 **5 Takeaways from Today:**
 
 1.MAC vs IP Addresses
   * You only need MAC addresses to communicate with network
   * 255.0.0.0/ 8bit
   * 255.255.0.0/ 16bit
   * 255.255.255.0/ 24 bit
   * Subnet tells what is network and host
 
 2. ARP
   * Address Resolution Protocol
   * Computer A look in ARP cache to see if Computer B
   * Sends out bfroadcast asking which comp has a specific MAC address. ARP cache makes network more efficient.
   * Saves address to table (cache)
   * 2 types of ARP: Dynamic and Static. Static is good if 2 devices are communicating with each other
       
 3. NAT and DHCP
   * Translate Address
   * DHCP Assigns private address
   * ISP gives/assigns public address and we pay provider
   * APIPA is for microsoft providers IP address DHCP server
   * When given an IP address and subnet mask and one can determine network #
 
 4. Why
   * Why do we subnet, to break up and easily manage network. Subnet mask helps determine what is network and what is host


 5. Appreciation of diversity
       * Valuing different perspectives and skills enriches problem solving and innovation while fostering inclusivity
