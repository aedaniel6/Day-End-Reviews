# Day-End-Review
 _2025-04-16_
 
 **Takeaways from today:**
 
Today was professional development and we basically did a recap on everything we discussed, from our personality test, to identifying our habits (good and bad) as well as talk about our past guest speakers.
Unfortunately our speaker today was unable to appear but, Ron went on to discuss discipline. We discussed discipline in the sense of habits/commitments and he had us to discuss what discipline do we exercise
in our lives and what is something we want to be more discipline about. I expressed that I was discipline about my fitness andwould like to be more disciplined about managing my study time more effciently.

We also took time today to over the first practice exam set as a class.
