**Takeaways from today**

1. Ethernet Switches
   * Straight- Top to Bottom cabling ( ex. router to switch, server to switch, pc/server to hub)
   * Crossover- literally cross cables (ex. router to router, pc to pc etc)
   * Rollover- is used for Inband management or console. Rollover cables help manage switch
   * Console- is RJ45 or USB ( USB is preferred). Console Port does not allow internet access but switch management
   * MDIX- made crossover cables obsoletes because of Auto feature.

2. Frames and Packets. Packet Sniffing Software
      * TAP Device- copies all frames passive and active 0's and 1's 
      * SPAN (Switch Port Analyzer)- located on switch. Actual port that collects traffic from specific port
      * What packet sniffing sofware is used? Wireshark (GUI) and Tcpdump (Terminal)
      
3. Ethernet Switch Types
   * Unamanged- not configured vs Managed- already configured
   * Stackable- operates as a single unit
   * Modular- wires can be change
   * Desktop- freestanding vs Rack Mount

4. Port Aggregation
   * combines links into single channel. Increased bandwith and provides redundancy in case of port failure
   * Port Mirroring is aka SPAN
   
5. Collision Domain
   * Is a group of hubs (nodes) that can "hear" each other
   * The more hubs the larger the collision domain
   * MAC or CAM table creates point to point connection
   * Hub makes one big collision domain
   * Every part of a switch splits the collision domain including port

6. POE (Power Over Ethernet)
   * Wires 1 and 2 transmit
   * Wires 3 and 6 receive
