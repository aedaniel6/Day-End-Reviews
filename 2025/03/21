_2025-03-21_

**4 takeaways from today**

1. Source Code Uses
      * To make changes and modifications
      * Some distros are not compiled
      * Curiousity
        
2. Why would you not use source code?
      * Pre compiled is preferrable
      * wget and curl are downloadable 

3. Process Management
   * In Linux, system processes are also called daemon processes
   * A process can have "children"
     1. every process has a system id
     2. "Grandparent" is the original process
     3. to "kill" a process you need the PID number
  
4. Process State
   * [R] running
   * [S] sleep
   * [T] traced or stopped
   * [Z] zombie

5. Find solutions to known problems. Look around and figure out how can this be made better or more sensible. For example, rolling suitcases or shirts with no tag etc
