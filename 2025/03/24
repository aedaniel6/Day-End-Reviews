 **4 Takeaways from today:**
 
 1. Digital Data
    * Has to be converted to wired digital signal or wireless ( antenna) analog signal
    * Converted via Network Interface Care (NIC)
        
2. Addressing
   * Hexadecimal- base 16. A-F 1-9
   * Binary- 0's and 1's. Base 2
   * Dotted deciaml number- broken into 4 parts. base 2

3. OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) 
   * Has 7 layers
     1. Physical Layer- consists of bits (0's and 1's), media that is either wired or wireless
     2. Data Link Layer- consists of NIC, MAC address (hardware), Access Point (wireless; antenna), Switch
     3. Network Layer- Logical addressing, IPv4 IPv6, Packets, Routers
     4. Transport Layer- Reliability, Either TCP (popular) or UDP (faster), Sequencing, Datagram
     5. Session Layer- Start, Maintain, Stop session
     6. Presentation Layer- Data Format and translation,Compression
     7. Application Client Interface

4. TCP-IP
An abbreviated OSI model
