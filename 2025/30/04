 **Takeaways from Today:**
 
 1. Today Ron Cofield came on and spoke with us about the value of time. He had us guess how many seconds were in a day wich led into a discussion about how we divide our time daily. What
  or rather how to we assign priority to daily tasks. Time is fair and equal in terms of it being limited. It is also valuable and should be managed carefully. Mr. Cofield used a phrase 
  called "Swallow the frog" which is a way to basically say do things at once and get it out the way insrtead of piecing it up. Do that workout in the morning if it is not your favorite 
  thing to do instead of waiting till later. Plan not only what needs to be done and the time frame but again consider priority. What could I do at theb onset so as I don't put myself in a 
  position to not do it later or worse not at all?
